Certainly! When starting with a Django project that incorporates JWT authentication, it's important to lay a solid foundation before moving on to more complex features. Here’s a suggested order for developing the apps, beginning with the most fundamental and building up to more complex functionality:

1. **User Profile Management (`profile`):**
   - **Reasoning:** Start with this app to establish the core user model and authentication mechanisms.
		It’s crucial for handling user information and authentication status, which are fundamental to any application with JWT.

2. **Task Management (`tasks`):**
   - **Reasoning:** Once you have user authentication in place, the next logical step is to implement a basic feature that involves managing user-specific data. Task management is a straightforward use case that will help you solidify your understanding of JWT authorization in practice.

3. **Comments and Reviews (`comments`):**
   - **Reasoning:** This app builds on user management and task handling, allowing users to interact with content. It provides a good opportunity to implement and test JWT-based access control for user-generated content.

4. **Blog or Content Management (`blog`):**
   - **Reasoning:** This app is more complex and involves handling more extensive content and permissions. By this point, you should be comfortable with JWT and user authentication, making it easier to manage content access.

5. **Messaging System (`messaging`):**
   - **Reasoning:** Adding messaging introduces real-time or near-real-time interactions, which can be more complex to manage. It’s a good next step after you have a solid foundation in place.

6. **Project Management (`projects`):**
   - **Reasoning:** This app involves multiple facets of user and project management. By now, you should be ready to handle more complex relationships and permissions, including user roles within projects.

7. **Event Management (`events`):**
   - **Reasoning:** Event management adds another layer of complexity with scheduling and user interaction. This app will build on the features and user interactions implemented in the previous apps.

8. **Notification System (`notifications`):**
   - **Reasoning:** Notifications often involve integration with various parts of the system. Implement this app last to leverage the features and interactions you've developed in the other apps and provide a comprehensive user experience.

### Summary

- **Start with** User Profile Management to set up user authentication.
- **Proceed with** Task Management and Comments and Reviews to add user-specific data and interactions.
- **Expand to** Blog or Content Management, Messaging System, and Project Management for more advanced features and relationships.
- **Finish with** Event Management and Notification System to add more complexity and functionality.
